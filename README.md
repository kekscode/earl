# earl

Earl is managing your URLs.

## Is it for you?

You use different browsers on the same desktop? Maybe even multiple devices
in your home network? Or you even use advanced technology like the interwebs
and command line terminals? Maybe a bookmark manager can help you.

If you hate bookmark syncing services, advertising-cluttered commercial
bookmark services and pointless featurism?

Earl tries to achieve this.
